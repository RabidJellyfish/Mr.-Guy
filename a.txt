- Change how objects/tiles are handled in level editor
	- Step based creation
	  eg. for box:
		1. size/rotation/position
		2. Other params (name)
	  for tile:
		1. size/rotation/position
	  for spotlight:
		1. rotation/position
		2. light radius/width
		3. rotation angle
		4. Other params (name, speed, color)
	  for camera:
		1. trigger area top left
		2. trigger area bottom right
		3. focus position
		4. Other params (name, focus %age)
	  for static collisions:
		1. point 1
		2. point 2
		3. ...
		x. return to first point
	  blank object - used exclusively for scripting
		1. Position
		2. Name
	  rope
		1. Position 1
		2. Position 2
	- EditObject
		All above would implement
		editor would have "current" editedobject
		fields
			- bool IsBeingEdited
			- bool IsBeingMoved
			- NextStep
			- Remove
			- Rotate, Resize, Flip
			- Vector2 position
	- Right click menu
- Scripts
	- Objects have list of script structs
		- name of script
		- list of string params
	- Collection of public static methods
	- Put in dictionary on game load
	- Make scripts global so certain scripts can't be triggered multiple times, even if level is reloaded

- Triggers
	- Steps
		1. Top left
		2. Bottom right
		3. Other (see paint)
	- Multiple triggers can have same name, when script loops through triggers, multiple will be checked
	- Level cycles through objects
		- objects cycle through scripts
			- scripts activated by triggers cycle through list of triggers
				if istriggered, activate script
