- Change how objects are handled in level editor
	- Step based creation, use common attributes to make creation easy
		Step 1:
			FacingLeft = x for flipping 				(enemies, guys)
			Width/Height/Scale = w/a || shift+(w/a/s/d) for resize	(boxes, triggers)
			Rotation = a/d || ctrl+(a/d) for angle			(boxes)
		Step 2:
			Radius = mouse position					(spotlights, balls)
			Position2 = mouse position				(strings, wires)
		Step 3:
			Other attributes = window popup
		^^^ Mostly change DrawMouse() method ^^^

	- Right click menu
		Could just be popup window because ez

- Scripts
	- Objects have list of script structs
		- name of script
		- list of string params
	- Collection of public static methods
	- Put in dictionary on game load
	- Make scripts global so certain scripts can't be triggered multiple times, even if level is reloaded

- Triggers
	- Separate from Game Objects
	- Steps
		1. Top left
		2. Bottom right
		3. Other (see paint)
	- Multiple triggers can have same name, when script loops through triggers, multiple will be checked
	- Level cycles through objects
		- objects cycle through scripts
			- scripts activated by triggers cycle through list of triggers
				if istriggered, activate script


- Add zoom to camera?
