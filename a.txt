- Change how objects are handled in level editor
	- Step based creation, use common attributes to make creation easy
		Step 1:
			FacingLeft = x for flipping 				(enemies, guys)
			Width/Height/Scale = w/a || shift+(w/a/s/d) for resize	(boxes, triggers)
			Rotation = a/d || ctrl+(a/d) for angle			(boxes)
		Step 2:
			Radius = mouse position					(spotlights, balls)
			Position2 = mouse position				(strings, wires)
		Step 3:
			Other attributes = window popup
