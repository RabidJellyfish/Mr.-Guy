TODO:
x Rewrite level editor until it's at the current state of the old one 
	x Make sure you keep old version until this step is finished
	x Better structure and stuff
	x Make everything the same type of object (tiles and objects are same type, will make things more organized probably)
	x Tiles will use separate textures instead of rectangles from a single spritesheet

x Add right click to remove in editor

3. Add static polygon drawing
	- Figure out how to remove these too

4. Move/rewrite "Farseer Test" code into the MrGuy game project
	- rewrite character control code
	- Static objects
	- Basic physics objects for testing
	- Keep xml loading code

x Add tiles to MrGuy game project

6. Write in save/load stuff
	- Use custom serializer (see http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/8644/XmlSerializer-and-not-expected-Inherited-			Types?msg=2391456#xx2391456xx)
	- Directly write MrGuy objects to xml rather than just data so that you can read them in easily?

7. See if you can load a level made in the level editor into the game with some static shapes and one of each tile
	- Hardcode in the creation of the character for now
