TODO:
1. Rewrite level editor until it's at the current state of the old one 
	- Make sure you keep old version until this step is finished
	- Better structure and stuff
	- Make everything the same type of object (tiles and objects are same type, will make things more organized probably)
	- Tiles will use separate textures instead of rectangles from a single spritesheet
	- Maybe change sidebar so that it only has 2 tabs

2. Add right click to remove in editor

3. Add static polygon drawing
	- Figure out how to remove these?

4. Write in save/load stuff

5. Move/rewrite "Farseer Test" code into the MrGuy game project
	- Character control code
	- Static objects
	- Basic physics objects for testing
	- Keep xml loading code

6. Add tiles to MrGuy game project

7. See if you can load a level made in the level editor into the game with some static shapes and one of each tile
	- Hardcode in the creation of the character for now

-------------------------------------------

8. Design stuff!
